 This tab shows you the feature importance for the columns being used to determine rankings. Using those features it gives you the top Universities by Country. It then runs a regression using the 4 features as the independent variables and "Score" as the dependent variable. 
 
# Tab4 - Predictive Modeling
  This tab will run a decision tree regression with selected variables and "Score" as the dependent variable. It will also give the MSE and Decision tree for the prediction. 
  
 # Tab5 - Grid Search
 This tab will run a K-means nearest neighbors regression with the selected value of K. 
 
 #  Tab6 - Comapring the MSE and R-sqaured for models. 
 This tab comapres the different models and gives us the best model for this dataset.
